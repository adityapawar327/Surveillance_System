# Advanced Person Detection Surveillance System

A modern, real-time surveillance system for accurate person detection, tracking, and event-based video management. Features a web interface, cloud storage, SMS alerts, advanced video compression, and robust logging.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- **YOLOv8 Person Detection**: Fast, accurate detection using Ultralytics YOLOv8.
- **ByteTrack Multi-Object Tracking**: Robust tracking of multiple people in the frame.
- **Live Web Interface**: Control and monitor your system from any browser using Gradio.
- **Flexible Camera Support**: Use a laptop webcam, Android IP camera, or any RTSP/HTTP stream.
- **Twilio SMS Alerts**: Instant notifications when someone enters or leaves the monitored area.
- **GPU Acceleration**: Automatic use of NVIDIA GPU for maximum performance (if available).
- **Customizable Detection Settings**: Adjust detection confidence, area threshold, patience, and more from the UI.
- **Automatic Video Saving**: Event-based video recording, saved in `surveillance_outputs`.
- **Advanced Video Compression**: Smart, multi-codec compression (H.265/HEVC, AV1, VP9, x264) for optimal size and quality.
- **Automatic S3 Cloud Upload**: Compressed videos are uploaded to your Amazon S3 bucket after each event. Public S3 URLs are sent via SMS and logged.
- **Concurrent & Optimized S3 Uploads**: Multi-threaded, thread-safe, and multipart S3 uploads for speed and reliability. Batch upload and progress tracking supported.
- **Detection Event Logging**: All detection events (entry/exit, video URL, SMS status) are logged to a daily file for audit and review.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration & Usage

### Camera Setup
- **Laptop Camera**: Uses your built-in webcam (index 0).
- **Android IP Camera**: Use the [IP Webcam app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pas.webcam) and set the IP in the UI or `.env`.
- **Custom URL**: Enter any RTSP/HTTP stream URL in the UI.

### Detection Settings
- **Detection Confidence**: Higher = fewer false positives.
- **Minimum Person Area**: Filter out small detections.
- **Exit Patience**: Time to wait before confirming a person has left.
- **Detection Threshold**: Frames needed to confirm presence.

### Cloud Storage (Amazon S3)
- **Automatic Upload**: After each detection event, the compressed video is uploaded to S3. The public URL is sent via SMS and logged.
- **Batch Upload**: Use `upload_all_videos_in_surveillance_outputs()` to upload all videos in `surveillance_outputs`.
- **Progress Tracking**: Use `upload_video_with_progress()` for real-time upload feedback.

### SMS Alerts (Twilio)
- **Setup**: Enter your Twilio credentials in the UI or `.env`.
- **Test**: Use the "Send Test SMS" button in the UI.

### Video Compression
- **Smart Compression**: Videos are compressed using the best codec for size/quality before upload.
- **Manual Compression**: Use `smart_compress_video()` for any video file.

### Logging
- **Event Logging**: All detection events are logged to a daily file (e.g., `detection_events_YYYYMMDD.log`).

## ‚ùì FAQ / Why Not Deployed Online?
- **Deep Learning & GPU**: Real-time inference and tracking require significant compute. Most cloud servers lack the necessary GPU acceleration.
- **Security & Privacy**: Surveillance systems process sensitive video feeds. For privacy, run this application locally on trusted hardware.
